# Sreality Scraper - Basic Prototype

This is a basic prototype of a web scraper for Sreality, a real estate website. The scraper is built using Scrapy and Docker for easy deployment.

## Features

- **Sreality Spider**: A Scrapy spider (`sreality/spiders/sreality_spider.py`) that extracts real estate data from the Sreality API.
- **PostgreSQL Pipeline**: A Scrapy pipeline (`sreality/pipelines.py`) that stores scraped data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RadekSimkanic/sreality-scraper-basic-prototype.git
